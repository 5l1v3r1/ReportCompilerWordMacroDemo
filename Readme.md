## What is ReportCompiler ?

A simple Java GUI capable of manipulating the XML output from various computer security scanners such as Nessus, Burp Suite etc. It allows you to delete, merge, re-write and provide evidence in a straight forward manner.

It is available here:

ReportCompiler by design does NOT export to a word document format. The reporting decisions you choose to make are your own and you need to make your own template and decide how you want to represent things.
